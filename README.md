# Promptly

A simple Python library for managing prompts using Jinja2 templates with YAML frontmatter support.

This library is based on these ideas:

- For AI projects, prompts are as important as code
- Prompts should be managed as files
- Prompts should support metadata such as version, author, description, and model instructions.
- Managing prompts should be easy by default

## Build

![Test](https://github.com/owainlewis/promptly/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

## Installation

```bash
pip install promptly-ai
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Create a prompt file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
version: 1.0.0
author: Owain Lewis
model: gpt-4
description: A simple greeting prompt with personality
---
You are a friendly and enthusiastic assistant. Your name is {{ name }} and you love helping people!

The current time is {{ time }}. How can I help you today?
```

Then use it in your Python code:

```python
from promptly_ai import PromptManager
from datetime import datetime

# Simple rendering
content = PromptManager.render("greeting.txt", name="Alex", time=datetime.now().isoformat())
print(content)

# Get metadata
model = PromptManager.get_model("greeting.txt")
print(f"Using model: {model}")  # "Using model: gpt-4"
```

### Prompt Formats

### Metadata Support

Prompts can include metadata in YAML frontmatter. Common metadata fields include:

```yaml
---
version: 1.0.0
author: Your Name
description: A description of the prompt
model: gpt-4  # or claude-3-opus, gpt-4-turbo, etc.
parameters:
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 2000
  top_p: 0.9
tags:
  - category: writing
  - difficulty: intermediate
  - use_case: creative
---
Your prompt content here
```

You can access metadata using convenience methods:

```python
from promptly_ai import PromptManager

# Get specific metadata fields
version = PromptManager.get_version("prompt.txt")
author = PromptManager.get_author("prompt.txt")
description = PromptManager.get_description("prompt.txt")
model = PromptManager.get_model("prompt.txt")

# Or get all metadata
metadata = PromptManager.get_metadata("prompt.txt")
print(f"Using {model} with parameters: {metadata['parameters']}")
```

### Advanced Usage

You can use any Jinja2 template features in your prompts:

```yaml
---
version: 1.0.0

model: gpt-4
description: A dynamic prompt generator based on user preferences
parameters:
  genre: [fantasy, sci-fi, mystery]
  length: [short, medium, long]
